# Keto Tracker Android App - Development Summary

## Project Overview

Successfully developed a comprehensive Android Keto Tracker application that combines features from two HTML programs (ketoNahrung.html and ketov10.0.html) into a modern, native Android application using MVVM architecture and Jetpack Compose.

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Features

#### Core Architecture
- **MVVM Architecture** with Clean Architecture principles
- **Room Database** with 3 entities (FoodItem, DailyLog, HealthMetric)
- **Hilt Dependency Injection** fully configured
- **Jetpack Compose UI** with Material Design 3
- **Repository Pattern** for data access abstraction
- **Coroutines + Flow** for reactive programming

#### Database Layer
- **FoodItem Entity**: Food database with carbs/calories per 100g
- **DailyLog Entity**: Daily food consumption tracking
- **HealthMetric Entity**: Health metrics with calculated BMI/GKI
- **Comprehensive DAOs** with complex queries
- **Type Converters** for Room database

#### Business Logic
- **13 Default Food Items** from original HTML
- **BMI Calculation**: Weight (kg) / Height (m)Â²
- **GKI Calculation**: (Glucose Ã· 18) Ã· Ketones Ã— 100
- **Carb Limit Monitoring**: 20g threshold for ketosis
- **Real-time Calculations** in ViewModels

#### User Interface
- **5 Main Screens**: Dashboard, Food, Health, Charts, Settings
- **Bottom Navigation** with Material Design 3
- **Reactive UI** with StateFlow and Compose
- **Form Validation** and error handling
- **Loading States** and user feedback
- **Keto-themed Color Scheme** (green palette)

#### Food Tracking Features
- Food database management (CRUD operations)
- Daily food intake logging
- Quantity-based carb/calorie calculation
- Visual carb limit progress indicator
- Today's food entries with edit/delete

#### Health Metrics Features
- Weight, waist, glucose, ketone tracking
- Blood pressure and pulse monitoring
- Automatic BMI and GKI calculation
- Notes field for additional context
- Date-based entry management

#### Data Management Foundation
- Repository pattern for data abstraction
- Offline-first architecture
- Data validation and error handling
- Prepared for import/export functionality

### ðŸš§ Placeholder Implementations

#### Charts & Visualization
- Chart screens created with placeholder UI
- Data preparation logic implemented
- MPAndroidChart dependency added
- Ready for chart library integration

#### Import/Export Functionality
- CSV and JSON dependencies included
- Repository methods prepared
- UI placeholders in Settings screen
- File provider configured in manifest

### ðŸ“‹ Technical Specifications

#### Build Configuration
- **Target SDK**: 34 (Android 14)
- **Min SDK**: 24 (Android 7.0)
- **Kotlin**: Latest version with coroutines
- **Compose**: Latest stable BOM
- **Room**: 2.6.1 with KTX extensions
- **Hilt**: 2.48 for dependency injection

#### Dependencies Summary
```kotlin
// Core: Compose, Navigation, Lifecycle
// Database: Room with coroutines
// DI: Hilt with Compose integration
// Data: OpenCSV, Gson for future export
// Charts: MPAndroidChart (ready for integration)
```
